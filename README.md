## ⚙️ Methodology (Excel Workflow)  
1. Forecasted **FY25 earnings and cash flows** using sector trends and peer performance.  
2. Applied **forward valuation multiples** (P/E, EV/EBITDA, EV/Revenue) for pricing simulation.  
3. Modeled **proceeds vs dilution sensitivity** to capture changes in ownership and float.  
4. Benchmarked JSW Cement against peers (UltraTech, Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat).  
5. Incorporated **issue expenses** (underwriting, SEBI, legal, and marketing fees) to estimate net proceeds.  
6. Built a **dynamic IPO dashboard** to visualize pricing bands, proceeds, and valuation metrics.
